If taking a walk doesn't do the trick ...

Have you ever tried reprogramming your subconscious mind?

Its tricky and its difficult, but it can be done.
The mind is like a computer, and when we become aware enough, we are the programmer.
We have all been programmed since we were young. For better or worse our mind has been molded into what it is today.
Years of reinforcing the same ideas and beliefs make this programming all the more strong.
You have to realize the identity you have is not set in stone. 
As Alan Watts famously said, "you have no obligation to be the same person you were 5 minutes ago."
So, let go of this imaginary obligation.
Be who you wish to be and dont answer when the mind starts asking doubtful questions.
This is where people get lost, they think about it too much.
The thoughts will adapt when your state of being changes.
You do this by constantly reinforcing the person you know that you are and deserve to be.
Personality is a psychological construct.
What we are is something much greater, we are the awareness of this personality.
When you know this, and you now do, you can use this practically to change the way your brain works.
Some call it fake it till you make it, but maybe it is a genuine reconstruction of oneself.
The core won't change (awareness) but everything else can, you can be someone past you would admire.
