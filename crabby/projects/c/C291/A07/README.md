Program takes input from stdin. Program then initializes buffer and processes the input, adding
new words until buffer must be reallocated or word capacity must be incremented. This repeats 
until EOF is discovered, then the provided print functions will execute as needed.

Steps

figure out what we need to do, so create a list of tasks for the user to choose from

pull the file into processing

find new words, and increment the word capacity as needed
^^same for each byte

perform calculations on the new data, and return the results requested by the user
